·         I measured 13 samples from 15.  I couldn’t measure 2 samples, 1670 and 1306.  There were few sperm in the samples and they were very thin, mostly broken and didn’t take up the stain very well.  In particular the heads wouldn’t stain which indicates no DNA.  I don’t know why.  I tried a few times with these samples and always got the same result.
·         Sample 1650 was very small and unlike the other samples – it didn’t look like a VD tubule.  I did manage to get a few sperm though, but I had to scan two entire slides to find about 20 good sperm (from a good sample I get that many from a small patch).  The sperm looked good though and no different from the other samples.
·         The sample 1323 had 2 exceptionally long sperm, I measured them just for fun (one was nearly twice the average length!!!), they are not included in the 10 measurements, but added below on the individual sheet for 1323 in case you want to have a look.
·         And just out of interest I measured one sample without staining.  Sample 329 (sheet 329 unst).  It is not included in the all sheet.  I couldn’t really discern the acrosomes, so they are included in the head measurements, also the different parts were more difficult to detect clearly so it’s mainly to just look at the overall length.
·         I saved each sample in a separate sheet (I find it easier to keep an overview that way) but have put them all together in the first sheet “all”.
